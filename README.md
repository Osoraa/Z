SO, TL;DR...

This would hold Zuri things for now...

## Gist!!!

I wouldn't say this is the very beginning of Dev...but this definitely the point where I start to make "that" thing here on out...

I've got some personal mentors and people who I really wanna be as good as if not even waay better than...yes, yes I know, shouldn't be a competition, but where's the fun...

All the above being considered, I figured I'd start to populate this git of a thing...

This is def's gonna get longer down the road 😂😂

For now, this repo is where I store all things uncategorized I work on...but rn thing's I'm studying;
--> Zuri Internship and I really wanna come out waay better than I was or am rn...🙏🏾

--> CS50 thingies...Taken me forever to finish this...

--> School ish
